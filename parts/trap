# Traps handling code

# Setup trap ($1) in case of interrupt or error.
# Traps explicitly do not exit on command error.
# Traps are first disabled to avoid executing clean-up commands twice.
# In the case of interrupts, exit is called to avoid the script continuing.
# $1 must either be empty or end in a semicolon.
settrap() {
    trap "set +e; trap - INT HUP TERM 0; $1 exit 2" INT HUP TERM
    trap "set +e; trap - INT HUP TERM 0; $1" 0
}

# Prepend a command to the existing $TRAP
addtrap() {
    OLDTRAP="$TRAP"
    TRAP="$1;$TRAP"
    settrap "$TRAP"
}

# Revert the last trap change
